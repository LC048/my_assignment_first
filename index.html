<h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
     Shah Rukh Khan, Shah Rukh also spelled Shahrukh, Indian actor known for his powerful screen presence. He was one of the most sought-after Bollywood actors.</p>
    <p>
    After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in economics from Hans Raj College, University of Delhi, and beginning a master’s degree in mass communications, Khan dropped out of academic studies to pursue a career in acting. He entered the film industry through work in theatre and television. His first acting jobs were in television serials such as Fauji (1988; in the role of a commando) and Circus (1989), which won him instant recognition. His breakthrough movie was Deewana (1992; “Crazy”), and it marked the turning point in his acting career.
    </p>
    <p>
    Initially Khan’s success was based on his antihero portrayals in Baazigar (1993; “Gambler”) and Darr (1993; “Fear”). He rejected the image of the conventional hero in both films and created his own version of the villain. In later films, however, he assumed the role of hero and helped produce such blockbusters as Dilwale dulhania le jayenge (1995; “The Big-Hearted Will Take Away the Bride”), Karan Arjun (1995), Dil to pagal hai (1997; “The Heart Is Crazy”), Kuch kuch hota hai (1998; Something Is Happening), Devdas (2002), Kal ho naa ho (2003; “Tomorrow May Never Come”), Veer-Zaara (2004), Chak de! India (2007; “Go, India!”), My Name Is Khan (2010), and Jab tak hai jaan (2012; “As Long as I Live”), the last film directed by Yash Chopra. In many of those films, Khan played the role of a sensitive lover or son. He also met success in comedic roles in films such as Chamatkar (1992; “Miracle”), Yes Boss (1997), Duplicate (1998), and Chennai Express (2013). Also noteworthy was his role as the emperor Ashoka in a film he produced, Ashoka the Great (2001). Khan’s later hit movies included Happy New Year (2014), an action comedy centring on a dance competition, and the crime drama Raees (2017), in which he played a bootlegger.</p>
